# William Sullivan's Portfolio

This is a website to suppliment my resume. It contains a [Blazor WebAssembly](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-6.0#blazor-webassembly client application deployed to Azure along with an [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview) API. The API has no meaningful functions currently, but exsists to be added to later.

The published website can be veiwed [here](https://www.williamsullivan.dev/).
