					<MudText>
						Hi, I’m Will, a software developer and physics graduate. Originally from England, I recently returned from a Working Holiday in Canada, and I am currently based in <strong>Tewkesbury, England</strong>.
					</MudText>

					<MudText>
						I graduated from the <strong>University of Birmingham, England</strong>, with a Master’s Degree in Physics, a course which prides itself on teaching problem solving and critical thinking. It was there that I really discovered my passion for developing robust, high performance code.
					</MudText>

					<MudText>
						I’ve worked on a range of projects, from smaller <strong>Python</strong> scripts, working with <strong>neural networks</strong> and <strong>machine learning</strong>, to mid size projects, utilising <strong>JavaScript</strong> to modify and enhance a browser based game, to larger projects, collecting and facilitating the analysis of oil production data for the entirety of Nigeria, requiring <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>SQL</strong>.

						I am currently seeking employment in the UK and will be considering moving if required. If you have an opportunity to discuss, please don’t hesitate to contact me, I’d love to speak further.
